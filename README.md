# Sun-Tracking-Solar-Panel-Project
For an efficient usage of solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a maximum extent. The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. So, to obtain maximum solar power the panels should be continuously placed towards the direction of the Sun.
The Sun tracking solar panel consists of two LDRs, solar panel and a servo motor and ATmega328 Microcontroller.
